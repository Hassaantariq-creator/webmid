                <div>  <p class="paragraph">It was the spring of 1962 which witnessed the birth of an institution which was later to develop into an educational giant. The infant institution initially started in a few rented rooms of the Gaddafi Stadium then known as the National Stadium, Lahore. Later on, the institution was shifted to Model Town, Lahore, when the co-operative Model Town Society Limited, in extending its gracious cooperation, gifted about 186 kanals of land for the construction of the school buildings. The first to be constructed among the school building was the present Boys’ Junior Wing building which was completed in 1965. In 1966 the school was raised to the level of a high School. The first batch of the talented scholars of this school took their matriculation examination in 1968. The same year yet another landmark was witnessed in the history of Divisional Public School when the School Boarding House started functioning with a Strength of Six students in the staff Residential Quarters. In 1969 the building of Boys’ Senior Wing, Model town was completed and the Senior School was shifted there. It also housed the Principal’s Office. In 1976, Divisional Public School touched new heights and became an intermediate college. Subsequently, the junior Model School Building was obtained from the Education Department and a Nursery & K.G Wing shifted there for the toddlers. In 1981, however, the Hostel was shifted to its present location, a spacious and grand building close by the School main Gate, which now hosts about 150 students every year and facilities for them a living a worthy of Publican scholar. Now, we can proudly say that DPS Hostel, Iqbal House, is a flourishing Boarding House housing students from Class 1to 2nd year. The same year the Girls’ Wing was started in the present Boys’ Junior School Building and girls for Class VI were admitted. In 1983-84 a new building for the Girls’ Wing was built and it housed the girls Class I to Class VIII with all facilities. Later on, the Girls’ Wing, Too, was upgraded to the status of a Girls’ College. In 1987, the first batch of student, comprising 54 Girls took their matriculation examination as regular students and thanks a lot to Allah Almighty 96.3% of them secured 1st Division. The academic results shown by our students in the Lahore Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education Matriculation and in the Cambridge O-Levels Examination have always been a source of pride for Publican family and reflect upon the visionary guidance of our Board of Governors, the leadership of the Principal and the hard work put in by the teachers and the students. Historically speaking, DPS has always been in the top positions. However, in the years 2015 and 2016.

A holistic approach to education is adhered to; whereby the student's whole being is given importance. The academic, physical, social, psychological, and spiritual dimensions of the student's personality are targeted. This is reflected in school policies and the related strategies and action. The College is, of course, a place where teaching and learning takes place. Faculty is not only present to teach academic subjects, but also to take a special interest in the student as an individual, with his/her strengths and limitations. The student comes to know and understand that he is valued as a person, and is therefore enabled and empowered, through his friends and family, to achieve his full potential and open him up to the world. A word of thanks and appreciation to all past and present students, families and staff, who have participated and/or are still participating in the life of the College, and make it what it is. May God, who is the initiator of all that is good, make this place even better with every rising sun!
